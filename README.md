# amazonPriceTracker
Simple Price Tracker program that gets an Amazon link for an item and the price the user is willing to pay. The program checks if the price of the item is less than or equal to the price the user is willing to pay. The program checks the price of the item every 24 hours. If the price fits the criteria, an email is sent to the user telling him/her to check out the link.
